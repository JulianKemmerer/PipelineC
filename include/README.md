Reorganizing...

Old Arty board files live, ex.
`PipelineC/examples/arty/src/vga/`
but then made a new dir at some point
`PipelineC/vga/`
but then started to organize include files like
`PipelineC/pipelinec/include/<vga>`

moving all those files and new ones into this dir 
ex. `PipelineC/include/vga/`
